This repository contains a collection of **Agent Skills for Notifly**. Each
skill is a self-contained package that can be loaded and executed by AI clients.

## Installing Skills

Agent skills in this repository are built on the
[open agent skills standard](https://agentskills.io/home). Please refer to the
[official documentation](https://agentskills.io/home#adoption) for up-to-date
information on supported AI clients. Depending on the AI client you are using,
you can install skills in different ways.

### Universal CLI (Recommended)

For Amp, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Goose, Letta, OpenCode, and VS
Code, we recommend using our installer to set up the skills and automatically
configure the Notifly MCP Server.

#### Installation Modes

The CLI supports two installation modes for skills:

1. **Repo Root (Project-specific)** - Installs skills to the current project
   directory (default)
   - Skills are available only for the current project
   - Best for project-specific configurations

2. **System Root (Global)** - Installs skills to your home directory
   - Skills are available across all projects
   - Best for personal development setup

**Note:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration is always set up
globally (system root), regardless of the skill installation mode. This ensures
the MCP server is available across all your projects.

```bash
# Install a specific skill (repo root - default)
npx notifly-agent-skills@latest install <skill-name> --client <your-client>
# For example, to install a skill on Cursor:
npx notifly-agent-skills@latest install integration --client cursor

# Install a specific skill globally (system root)
npx notifly-agent-skills@latest install <skill-name> --client <your-client> --global
# For example:
npx notifly-agent-skills@latest install integration --client cursor --global

# Install all available skills at once (repo root)
npx notifly-agent-skills@latest install --all --client cursor
# Currently, this installs: integration

# Install all available skills globally (system root)
npx notifly-agent-skills@latest install --all --client cursor --global
```
